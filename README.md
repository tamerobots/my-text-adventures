my-text-adventures
==================


A Website for the Generation and Hosting of Interactive Fiction. Final Year University Project. SQL, VB.NET, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS.

This is an unfinished project - it needs a proper admin interface, and a LOT of other things.

You can view the project page at https://www.tamerobots.com/projects/my-text-adventures for an overview.

You can read the full documentation in the 'Documentation - My Text Adventures.doc' file.

Some bits are a little rushed as I had to have it in for my university deadline, so it's a little rusty around the edges! It's not production-ready and needs a proper security and performance audit.

Read the mit-licence file for the licence.

Contact me at dave@tamerobots.com if you'd like to ask me any questions about it.
