==================

A Website for the Generation and Hosting of Interactive Fiction. Final Year University Project. ASP.NET, HTML, CSS.

This is an unfinished project - it needs a proper admin interface, and a LOT of other things. 

Some bits are a little rushed as I had to have it in for my university deadline, so it's a little rusty around the edges!

Read the mit-licence file for the licence. 

Contact me at dave@tamerobots.com if you'd like to ask me any questions about it.
