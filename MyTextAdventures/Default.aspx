<h1>Let's write a Story!</h1>
<h2>What is this site about?</h2>
<p class="pagetext">
My Text Adventures is a place to create, publish and play Text-Based Adventures.
</p>
<h2>What are those?</h2>
<p class="pagetext">
Text-based adventures are a form of computer game that first came to prominence in the late 70's.<br />
 The use of graphics was very limited at the time as home computers often had very small graphics processing capabilities, so a way around this was to give up the use of graphics entirely and create a game that only used text.<br />
 Essentially Interactive Fiction is a cross between a novel and a more conventional graphics-based video game. These games, also known as 'interactive fiction', 
 are still played today, and a thriving community exists online which archives old games, with competitions held periodically to create new ones.<br />
 </p>
 <h2>How do you play them?</h2>
 <p class="pagetext">
The game is played using a command-line interface and keyboard, akin to an application such as the Windows command prompt.<br />
 Text is entered by the user, the game works out what the user wants to do, figures out whether they can do it in the logic of the game, and displays text to show the result.<br />
 As the game has no visual clues involved, a lot of guesswork is involved, but this is one of the best parts of the game. <br />
 Each player is free to imagine the game world as they see fit!<br />
 <br />
 My Text Adventures brings Interactive Fiction to a modern audience by combining the accessibility and global audience of
 the internet with a reliable, easy-to-use environment within which to both author and play these games.
