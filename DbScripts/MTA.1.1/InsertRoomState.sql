   'here is a looooooooooooooong description my son. A variable-length string. M  represents the maximum column length in characters. In MySQL 5.0, the range of M  is 0 to 255 before MySQL 5.0.3, and 0 to 65,535 in MySQL 5.0.3 and later. The effective maximum length of a VARCHAR in MySQL 5.0.3 and later is subject to the maximum row size (65,535 bytes, which is shared among all columns) and the character set used. For example, utf8 characters can require up to three bytes per character, so a VARCHAR column that uses the utf8 character set can be declared to be a maximum of 21,844 characters. MySQL stores VARCHAR values as a one-byte or two-byte length prefix plus data. The length prefix indicates the number of bytes in the value. A VARCHAR column uses one length byte if values require no more than 255 bytes, two length bytes if values may require more than 255 bytes. ',
